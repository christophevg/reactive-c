Reactive C
An experiment/tutorial on implementing reactive programming (RP) ideas in C.

---

The origin of this repository is a paper "Deprecating the Observer
Pattern with Scale.React". The goal of this repository is to implement the
ideas from this paper in C, thus making it available to e.g. embedded
development in C.

Every commit in this repository addresses one of the topics raised in the above
mentioned paper. This way it's an experiment, to see if we can actually
formulate a valid way to write reactive-style code in C, and once completed it
can serve as a tutorial on how to do it.

Rationale

The core of RP is an implementation of the observer pattern. This is also the
starting point of the paper. As a first step we implement this design pattern,
try to identify the same problem areas, as described in the paper, and
formulate solutions to them in subsequent commits.
