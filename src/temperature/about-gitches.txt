About Glitches

Glitches occur when changes haven't fully propagated to all observed entities.
An example:

  Observable --> Observer A -> Observer B
            `---------------------^

Observer B should not trigger its functionality simply when Observable has been
updated. Only when Observer A has processed the change of the Observable,
Observer B should trigger its functionality using the latest value of both
Observable and Observer A.

We solve this problem by introducing the concept of levels. In this example
Observable is at level 0, Observer A is at level 1 and Observer B is at level
2. The level can be determined based on the levels of all observed entities and
is defined as the highest level of those plus 1.

When pushing updates through this network, we notify each level in its turn.
This way glitches are avoided.

Levels are (re)computed when an observer is added or removed.
