TODO
- introduce emit() + fix script to be real observable
- introduce script looping (e.g reintroduce resuspended observable)
- introduce (push/)pull strategy
  - on whole graph or on more fine-grained basis (observable,links)?
- can do_#type() trick be applied to more? (cfr fold)
- implement loop-detection
  - probably only warning, loops are valid (e.g. controller/feedback loop)
- introduce time, timeout
- introduce sample (can this be a script?)
- improve garbage collection (freeing of observable_lists)
- make execution of observe_update async -> really needed?
